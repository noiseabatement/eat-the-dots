=======
The game is kinda agar.io but for single player. Idea of this project is belong to my girlfriend. There are two phases in the game. 
Red Phase: you should try to escape from randomly generated enemies. If they touch you, player's radius will get smaller. If it reaches 0 game is over.
White Phase: This is funny part. You can eat enemies. everytime you eat enemy your radius will grow 10px.

Problems:
Major performance issues. Game freezes for couple miliseconds randomly. My guess is requestAnimationFrame function creates canvas everytime when it triggered.
Actually this is not a way that i would prefer but i couldn't come up with another solution.
Also i want to add difficulty levels. it seems easy because only thing that i want to change is time of respawn and time of phase change.
